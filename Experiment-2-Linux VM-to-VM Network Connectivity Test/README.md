Linux VM-to-VM Network Connectivity Test

📌 Overview

This experiment demonstrates basic network connectivity between two Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machines running in VirtualBox. The ip a command was used to identify the network interface and IP address of each VM, followed by the ping command to verify communication between them.

🎯 Objective

Identify the IP address of each Ubuntu VM.

Check the status of the network interface.

Test connectivity between two virtual machines.

Verify packet delivery and network latency using ICMP ping.

IP Network

10.0.2.0/24

🖥️ VM 1

The first Ubuntu VM was configured with:

Interface : enp0s3
IP Address: 10.0.2.15/24

The interface was verified using:

ip a

Connectivity to the second VM was tested with:

ping 10.0.2.4

Result

8 packets transmitted, 8 received, 0% packet loss
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.298/0.584/0.787/0.140 ms

This confirms that VM 1 successfully communicated with VM 2.

🖥️ VM 2

The second Ubuntu VM was configured with:

Interface : enp0s3
IP Address: 10.0.2.4/24

The interface was verified using:

ip a

Connectivity to the first VM was tested with:

ping 10.0.2.15

Result

6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0% packet loss
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.339/0.597/0.825/0.190 ms

This confirms that VM 2 successfully communicated with VM 1.

ip a

This command displays the available network interfaces, their state, MAC addresses, IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses.

2. Test connectivity

From VM 1:

ping 10.0.2.4

From VM 2:

ping 10.0.2.15

Press Ctrl + C to stop the continuous ping test and display the statistics.

✅ Conclusion

The two Ubuntu virtual machines were successfully connected through the VirtualBox network. Both VMs were able to reach each other using ICMP ping, with 0% packet loss in both tests. This verifies successful basic network communication between the virtual machines.
